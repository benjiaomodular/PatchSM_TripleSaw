# Triple Saw

Arduino code for a CV-controllable triple saw oscillator for the Daisy Patch Submodule (tested with the patch.init()).

- CV_1 - coarse tune
- CV_2 - fine tune
- CV_3 - detune spread
- CV_5 - v/oct

This is based on [beserge's TripleSaw example](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyDuino/tree/master/examples/Patch%20SM/TripleSaw) in the Electro-Smith repository.
